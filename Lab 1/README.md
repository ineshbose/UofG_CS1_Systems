# Lab 1 (23/01/20)

## Task
Using LogicSim, complete the following tasks:

* Create a little circuit that contains an Input, an inverter and an Output.
* Create a circuit that contains an and2 gate and connect it to two inputs. Simulate the circuit with all four combinations of inputs 00, 01, 10 and 11.
* Test the or2 and xor2 logic gates the same way. In each case, build a truth table using the simulator.
* Test the half adder circuit. Generate a truth table for the circuit and check that the half adder is working correctly.
* Do the same for full adder circuit.
* Do the same for the multiplexer circuit mux1.
